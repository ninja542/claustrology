				<h2> A detailed analysis on how zodiacs and horoscopes work</h2>
				<p> Light from stars travels a really long distance, from the star to your eyes. In the old days, light used to travel through ether, which sent shockwaves throughout the universe, which then hits the earth and affects your daily life. </p>
				<p> Since scientists dispproved the ether theory, the current understanding is that the microgravitational effects of the stars is what actually influences people.</p>
				<p> Ancient humans looked at these same stars, and they saw pretty pictures in these points of light. They connected the dots and twelve of these pictures were chosen to form the Zodiac.</p>
