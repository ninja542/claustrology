				<h2> A detailed analysis on how zodiacs and horoscopes work</h2>
				<h3> A brief history </h3>
				<p> Light from stars travels a really long distance to your eyes. In the old days, light used to travel through ether, which sent shockwaves throughout the universe, which then hits the earth and affects your daily life. </p>
				<p> Since scientists dispproved the ether theory, the current understanding is that the microgravitational effects of the stars is what actually influences people.</p>
				<p> Ancient humans looked at these same stars, and they saw pretty pictures in these points of light. They connected the dots and twelve of these pictures were chosen to form the Zodiac.</p>
				<p> Then astrologers assigned random dates to these weird star pictures. They didn't use the twelve months because they wanted to be edgy and dank with their dates. And then they started doing that whole predicting your future with star pictures.</p>
				<h3> Plants and horoscopes </h3>
				<p> Plants make your life better by providing oxygen so you can lyfe.</p>
				<h3> Planets and horoscopes </h3>
				<p> You know all the 8 planets, right? Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Also Pluto if you believe it's still a planet. These planets don't have much gravitational influence on daily lives, but they are pretty to look at. Planets are just giant chunks of rocks, so their effect is different from stars, which are giant nuclear fission reactors. </p>
				<p>The Earth looks like it's the center of the universe, but it isn't actually, so the planets look like they cross the sky a bit and then become indecisive and turn around. This is called a retrograde because the planets are old, forgetful, and nostalgic for retro things. And this is supposed to make bad shit happen in your life even though nobody can see these f**king planets anyways.</p>
				<h3> Making horoscopes </h3>
				<p> So I have this microscope, computer, and this dank physics knowledge, which I expertly use to spin a wheel with random adjectives to predict futures. I also consult my dark magic book, which is totally different from the summoning satan one.</p>
				<p> Rest assured that you are getting the best possible horoscopes. </p>
